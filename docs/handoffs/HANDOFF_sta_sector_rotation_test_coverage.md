# HANDOFF: STA (Swing Trade Analyzer) — Test Coverage for `/api/sectors/rotation`

> **Status:** DRAFTED, not yet relayed. Test file below is fully written and **verified live** against the actual running `localhost:5001` server (9/9 checks passed, Jul 29 2026) — not just proposed.
> **Source:** Trading Intelligence Hub, Session 38 (Jul 29 2026) — researched `/api/sectors/rotation` while building its own sector/theme advisory panel (a separate, read-only tool in `trading-intelligence-hub/research/sector_advisory/`), which pulls STA's broad-sector data live for context. Read `backend/backend.py:2196-2470` directly rather than assuming; grepped `backend/tests/` and every `test_*.py` in the repo for any existing coverage of this endpoint — found none.

## Finding

`/api/sectors/rotation` has real, non-trivial computation (RS-ratio via a static-midpoint-normalized ETF/SPY ratio, 10-day momentum, a 4-quadrant classification, a `macro_alignment` cross-check against the Context tab's regime read, plus a QQQ/MDY/IWM size-rotation signal) — none of it covered by any automated test. The rest of the repo's own test files (`backend/test_categorical_comprehensive.py`, `backend/backtest/test_verdict_parity.py`) show a real testing discipline exists here; this endpoint just isn't part of it yet.

**Not a bug** — the endpoint's own logic checked out fine on inspection, and the "swing-trading variant of RRG, not standard de Kempenaer RRG" self-documentation (`backend.py:2318-2320`, cross-referenced against `docs/research/UNIVERSAL_PRINCIPLES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s own "Bug 0E-F" entry) is honest and was already deliberately left as-is by your own Day 69 self-review. This handoff is purely about closing the untested gap, not revisiting that decision.

## What's provided

A ready-to-drop-in test script, `test_sector_rotation.py`, matching this repo's own established convention exactly (`test_categorical_comprehensive.py`'s style: standalone script, `requests` against the live server, colored pass/fail output) rather than introducing a pytest/mock dependency this repo doesn't otherwise use.

It deliberately does **not** assert exact `rsRatio`/`rsMomentum` values — today's real market numbers aren't a fixed target. Instead it checks structural invariants that would catch a real regression:

1. All 11 SPDR sectors present, every response field on every row
2. **`quadrant` is internally consistent with `rsRatio`/`rsMomentum`** — recomputes the same `(RS>=100, Momentum>=0)` rule locally and diffs it against what the endpoint actually returned. This is the one that would catch a future refactor accidentally flipping a `>=` to a `>`, or a sign error — the kind of change that wouldn't show up any other way without staring at real numbers by hand.
3. `mapping` dict covers all 11 ETFs' GICS/TradingView names
4. `size_rotation`/`size_signal` shape, plus the same internal-consistency check applied to the IWM-vs-QQQ diff rule
5. A sanity-bounds check on `rsRatio` (40–300) — wide enough to never false-positive on real market moves, tight enough to catch a gross units bug (e.g. a ratio left at `0.xx` instead of `x100`)

**Verified live, not just written:** ran against the actual `localhost:5001` server this session — all 9 checks passed on real data (`size_signal` came back `Risk-On`, IWM-QQQ diff +5.64, consistent with the rule).

Sector Rotation Endpoint Test Suite — Day 92-equivalent
Drafted by the Trading Intelligence Hub (Session 38, Jul 29 2026), verified
live against a running backend before handoff.

/api/sectors/rotation has real RS-ratio/momentum/quadrant computation
(backend.py:2258-2470) but no automated test coverage anywhere in this repo
-- found while an external session (the hub) was researching this endpoint
for its own purposes and grepped backend/tests/ + every test_*.py for any
reference, finding none.

Matches this repo's own established test convention (test_categorical_
comprehensive.py): a standalone script hitting the live running server via
requests, not a pytest/mock suite -- this repo has no pytest usage outside
vendored packages, so a mocked unit-test file would be inconsistent with how
everything else here is actually run and reviewed.

Deliberately does NOT assert exact rsRatio/rsMomentum values (today's real
numbers are the point, not a fixed golden value) -- instead asserts
structural invariants that would catch a real regression:
  1. All 11 SPDR sectors present, every required field on every row
  2. quadrant is INTERNALLY CONSISTENT with rsRatio/rsMomentum -- recomputes
     the same (RS>=100, Momentum>=0) rule locally and checks it matches what
     the endpoint returned. This is the one that would actually catch a
     future refactor accidentally flipping a >= to a > or a sign.
  3. mapping dict covers real GICS/TradingView sector names
  4. size_rotation / size_signal shape is sane
  5. sanity-bounds check (rsRatio in a plausible range) -- catches a gross
     units bug without pinning an exact value

## Suggested placement

`backend/test_sector_rotation.py`, alongside the existing `backend/test_categorical_comprehensive.py` — same directory, same convention.

## Not included in this handoff (out of scope, flagged only)

- The `yfinance`-vs-Tradier data-provider question — the hub's own advisory panel mitigates this on its own side (a visible divergence flag when its Tradier-derived sub-industry reads and this endpoint's yfinance-derived broad-sector reads disagree sharply) rather than asking STA to change a working, cached, live data pipeline.
- The static-midpoint-vs-EMA normalization question — already a considered, documented decision from your own Day 69 review (Option 1 chosen deliberately over Option 2's higher blast radius). Not being revisited here.
